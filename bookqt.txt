The only limit to our realization of tomorrow is our doubts of today.
Life is what happens when you're busy making other plans.
To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.
Success is not the key to happiness. Happiness is the key to success.
It always seems impossible until it's done.
The journey of a thousand miles begins with one step.
